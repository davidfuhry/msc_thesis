# Image Based Digitization of Historic Musical Storage Media

This repository contains the the source files for David Fuhrys master thesis on "Bildbasierte Digitalisierung von historischen Toninformationstr√§gern" (Image Bases Digitization of Historic Musical Storage Media).

The software described here can be found in the [digital-organology/historic-music-storage-media-digitization](https://github.com/digital-organology/historic-music-storage-media-digitization) repository. We are currently in the process of expanding and consolidating this software into a new python package for later publication on PyPi which can be found at [digital-organoloy/hmsm](https://github.com/digital-organology/hmsm). The original repository can be considered deprecated and is only maintained for archival purposes.
