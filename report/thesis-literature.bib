    abstract = "SentimentWortschatz, or SentiWS for short, is a publicly available German-language resource for sentiment analysis, opinion mining etc. It lists positive and negative sentiment bearing words weighted within the interval of [-1; 1] plus their part of speech tag, and if applicable, their inflections. The current version of SentiWS (v1.8b) contains 1,650 negative and 1,818 positive words, which sum up to 16,406 positive and 16,328 negative word forms, respectively. It not only contains adjectives and adverbs explicitly expressing a sentiment, but also nouns and verbs implicitly containing one. The present work describes the resources structure, the three sources utilised to assemble it and the semi-supervised method incorporated to weight the strength of its entries. Furthermore the resources contents are extensively evaluated using a German-language evaluation set we constructed. The evaluation set is verified being reliable and its shown that SentiWS provides a beneficial lexical resource for German-language sentiment analysis related tasks to build on.",

abstract = {Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking
event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent. Conspiracy
theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to understand
them and to limit their propagation. It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods
to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities. What do
users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring
elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users
think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions
in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions.
We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents, the
actions they perform, and their targets. By computationally detecting agent?action?target
triplets in conspiratorial statements, and grouping them into semantically coherent
clusters, we develop a notion of narrative-motif to detect recurring patterns of triplets.
For example, a narrative-motif such as "governmental agency-controls-communications"
represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how
governmental agencies control information. Thus, narrative-motifs expose commonalities
between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances.
In the process, these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy
theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about. Our approach enables
a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media
with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.},

  abstract={Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and low trust. Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the COVID-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of scientific consensus on the virus's spread and containment, or on the long-term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of cell phone towers, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders, and wide-scale defiance of scientifically sound public mandates such as those to wear masks and practice social distancing, countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of rumors and conspiracy theories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling these stories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.},

A corpus of 1,627 articles from 9 political publishers, three each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left, and the hyperpartisan right, have been fact-checked by professional journalists at BuzzFeed: 97{\%} of the 299 fake news articles identified are also hyperpartisan. We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share significantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been confirmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way. Applications of our results include partisanship detection and pre-screening for semi-automatic fake news detection.",
